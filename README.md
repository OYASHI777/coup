# Coup The Resistance Bot ðŸš€

## Description
An attempt to create a bot that plays Coup, by employing a modified version of Counterfactual Regret Minimization. 

## Features
ðŸŸ¢ **Basic game simulation**  
    ðŸŸ¢ Handles full Coup game flow  
    âšª Better game design architecture instead of many branches  
  
ðŸŸ¡ **Card counting mechanism for pruning search**  
    ðŸŸ¢ Create brute force tracker for validation  
    ðŸŸ¡ Create memoized card counter for quicker querying of impossible states  
    âšª Front-end visualization  

âšª **State Probability Tracker**  
    âšª Use a GPU Compute Shader to compute probability of a particular card permutation state  

âšª **Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR)**  
    âšª Basic CFR  
    âšª CVFPR  
    âšª CVFPR + RL
